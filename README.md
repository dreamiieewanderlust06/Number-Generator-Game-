**About the Project:**
The Number Guessing Game is a fun and interactive Python game where the computer selects a random number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess the number. The game provides helpful hints about the number’s properties, such as whether it’s odd or even, whether it’s a prime number, and whether it’s divisible by 3 or 5. The game aims to make guessing numbers more engaging by providing mathematical facts, while also testing your guessing and reasoning skills.

**Features:**
Random Number Generation: The game picks a random number between 1 and 100 for the user to guess.

**Hint System:** After each guess, the game gives hints such as:
Is the number odd or even?
Is the number prime or composite?

**Attempts Tracking:** The game tracks and displays the number of attempts made by the player to guess the number.

**User-Friendly Interface:** The game prompts the player for guesses and provides clear messages on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

**How It Works:**
The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
The player guesses the number.
Based on the guess, the game provides hints about the number (odd/even, prime, divisibility by 3 or 5).
The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
The game ends when the correct number is guessed, and it shows how many attempts were made.

**Technologies Used**
Python 3.x
Random module for generating random numbers

**How to Play:**
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Run the script in a Python environment.
Input your guesses when prompted.
Use the hints to make informed guesses and try to guess the number with as few attempts as possible.
